# Casino-War-Of-Hearts

# NYU-SD-01 Milestone Project: Planning

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at <https://github.com/AndreTaq/Casino-War-Game>.

## Project Description

Casino War of hearts is simply played between player and the house, each player and the house will get one card and higher card wins

## Game Logic

Casino war of hearts is a simple card game, typically played by two players each player will get one card and who ever have the highest card value will win the round and if they have the same value it will be a tie. In this case we are playing against the house. The player will have buttons to press to get the game going, also the game has an option to keep or reset the score and start over. when the player win there will be a score updated with a note message says You Won!!, if the player losses there will be a note message says House Won and if the player and house tie there will be a note message says It's a Drew.
